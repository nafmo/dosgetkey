GetKey - A simple program that waits for a key
A Softwolves Software Release in 2000

LICENSE

This public is released to the public domain. That means that you can do
anything you want with it. But if you do change the program, I would very much
like to hear from you.

This documentation file is copyrighted, however; if you change this document,
you have to retain the last three lines containing my name and address.
(However, there is nothing stopping you from writing a new documentation and
dropping this, other than that it would be unkind).


USEAGE

GetKey waits for a key, and lets you know which it got. It can also show a
prompt and/or the current time while doing this.

GetKey knows the keys F1-F12, Escape and Enter, and will return the numbers 0
(Escape), 1-12 (F1-F12), 13 (Enter) or 14 (waited too long), depending on what
happens. If you do not wish to handle certain keys, they can be disabled.

GetKey understand these command line parameters, which may be entered in any
order on the command line, and which may be combined (i.e /VB is the same
thing as /V /B).

/B makes GetKey beep if you press a key that it does not understand. By
   default, GetKey does not make any sounds.

/C will center the cursor on the screen. Currently requires that the screen is
   80 characters wide, though. By default, the prompt will be flushed left.

/D will display the date and time before the prompt. It will use the local
   date format, as selected in the COUNTRY statement in CONFIG.SYS (however,
   see also /L below). By default, no date will be shown.

/L will, if used in conjunction with /D, display the date in a verbose format,
   containing the weekday and month names.

/P will display a prompt (can be used together with /D). The prompt text
   should follow directly after the P. If the prompt text contains spaces, the
   whole thing needs to be quoted, i.e: "/PGreetings, Dr. Falken". By default,
   no prompt will be shown.

/V will make GetKey print the name of the key pressed (or timeout, if the
   timeout passes) when exiting. By default, GetKey will not print anything on
   exit.

A numeric value, which will be interpreted as the number of seconds to wait
before returning the timeout value. The default is 30 seconds.

A key name ("Escape", "F1"-"F12" or "Enter"), which specifies that this key
should be ignored, and not result in exiting the program. By default, all the
keys described are enabled. If a disabled key is pressed and /B is enabled,
GetKey will beep as if an illegal key was pressed.

Sample command line:
  GETKEY "/BCDLVPWhat do you want to crash today?" Enter
enables exactly everything that you can enable, but disable the Enter key.


HISTORY

2000-  -   - v1.0 - First public version

This program was written for Don Alt. If you think that it sucks, he's the one
to blame, since he wrote the specs :-) But, if you think that it sucks, you
should really change it. Use the Source, Luke!


INCLUDED FILES

getkey.c   - Source code
getkey.exe - DOS binary
getkey.doc - You're reading it


REQUIREMENTS FOR COMPILATION

This program was written using Borland Turbo C++ 1.0 for DOS. You'll most
probably need to use a Borland Turbo C derivative to compile it, or you'll
have to port it. Sorry for that. If it had been more compiler-general and so,
I'd probably would had released it under copyright, anyway.
